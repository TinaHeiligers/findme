This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This is the result of my stackathon project at Grace Hopper Academy, 2017.

To run this app locally, on the terminaly go:

1. git clone https://github.com/TinaHeiligers/findme.git.
2. npm install
3. npm test

If the tests all pass, you're good to go. Please note that the randomization of cards test might fail. This is ok, just run it again and it should pass. I have not implemented a 'set seed' method to ensure that the cards always shuffle into a completely different order.

_**Disclaimer:*_
_This game's WIP_

To Do:
1. Add timer on turn duration
2. Add who's turn it is next
3. randomise card deck with new games
4. Consider varying number of cards played.
