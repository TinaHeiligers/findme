This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This project is the result of my stackathon at Grace Hopper Academy, 2017.

To run this app locally, on the terminaly go:

1. git clone https://github.com/TinaHeiligers/findme.git.
2. npm install
3. npm run start

The game will now open up on localhost://3000
